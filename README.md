# Illinois_Workplace_Wellness_Study
## I.	Overview
Illinois Workplace study is a large-scale randomized controlled trial aimed to find out the effectiveness of the workplace wellness programs, if it is improving employees’ health. This study was helded at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and 4,834 employees were in the study. They were randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group. Through regression analysis and careful interpretation of the results, this case offers insights into both the effectiveness and limitations of wellness programs, providing guidance for employers considering similar initiatives.

## Case Description
1.	To make the causal effect be true in this comparison, two firms must be comparable in all other aspect. For example, employee demographics, firm size, industry, baseline health conditions of workers, and access to healthcare. However, this condition is hard to satisfied in the real world. Firms that chose to have the wellness program may already take employee health seriously, or have more resources to invest in wellness, even attract a healthier or more motivated workforce. In conclusion, these differences will lead to selection bias. The difference that been observed in spending may reflect underlying differences between firms rather than the effect of the wellness program.

2.	To make the causal effect valid in this comparison, employees who are eligible and ineligible for the wellness program must be similar in all other aspects. For example, they should have comparable job types, departments, employment status. However, this condition is unlikely to be satisfied in the real world. Employees eligible for the wellness program may differ systematically from those who are not, such as having more flexible schedules, better access to information, or stronger health interest. In conclusion, these differences can lead to selection bias. The observed outcome differences may reflect pre-existing differences between employees rather than the true effect of the wellness program.


3.	In the Illinois Workplace Wellness Study, “treatment” refers to members that were invited to take paid time off to participate in the wellness program, while “control” refers to members that were not allowed to participate in the wellness program. The terms “participant” and “non-participant”, on the other hand, refer to whether an employee actually chose to take part in the wellness program after being assigned to the treatment group. According to the data, 3,300 employees were in the treatment group and 1,534 employees were in the control group. Out of those in the treatment group, 1,771 employees completed the initial screening in the first year of the program.

## III.	Conclusion
Through the analysis, we find out that there is no strong evidence that the wellness program had significant effect on employees’ health coverage and medical spending. The difference between treatment and control group were insignificant, showing the validity of random assignment. Also, the with and without demographic were almost identical, indicates that treatment and control group were similar, and other factors are unlikely to affect the results. However, when comparing participants and non-participants, we still observed difference even after adjusting for demographic. This shows that there may be selection bias. For example, people who are more aware of health problem may choose to join the program. Therefore, although random assignment indicates causal effect, we should carefully compare the participation.
